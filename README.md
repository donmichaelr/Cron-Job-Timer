# Cron Job Timer

This will allow you to run multiple con tasks using a single script. (useful on shared hosting that has a limited number of cron tasks)

 - Schedule "cron-run-timer.php" as a 5 minute cron on your hosting account.
 - Edit "cron-run-timer.php" to run your tasks on a 1 hour, 5 minute, 10 minute, 20 minute, 30 minute interval.
